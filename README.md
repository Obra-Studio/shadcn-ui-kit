# shadcn-ui-kit

This repository solely exists to discuss issues within GitHub issues. 

To ask for access to our shadcn/ui kit, which will be released soon but is right now in alpha, please contact me: johan@obra.studio

We are currently building out the kit with a private team to come out with an opinionated kit at the right point in time.

But we would love some feedback on what we're doing. First in a little private community and later in public.

Want to chat about it? You can book a call via https://cal.com/wolfr/30min
