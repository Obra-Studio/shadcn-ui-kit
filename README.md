## What is Obra-Studio/shadcn-ui-kit?

This is a design library file that implements https://v4.shadcn.com/.

This library will evolve over time as it tracks the evolutions in shadcn. 

Every layer was drawn for scratch, based on the v4 docs. nothing was copy/pasted from another file or kit.

The tailwind colours were sourced from [Yusuf Matraâ€™s kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1371714528425686824/tailwindcss-colors-v4-1-latest-update-2025) which was deemed accurate with the official website.

The only part that was not made from scratch are the icons by [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/) for which you can find the license [here](https://lucide.dev/license).

## Why a repo?

This repository solely exists to discuss issues within GitHub issues. 

I find GitHub issues to have one of the best user interfaces for tracking issues.

Might be a bit weird to use a coding tool to track issues, but I kind of like it.

We are currently building out the kit with a private team to come out with an opinionated kit at the right point in time.

But we would love some feedback on what we're doing. First in a little private community and later in public.
