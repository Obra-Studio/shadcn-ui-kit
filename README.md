This kit is considered open source, but not open contribution. What we mean by this is that for quality control reasons, we need to know that whoever is editing the kit is a skilled designer who know how to keep the kit as intact as possible.

However, we'd like to have a healthy discourse about the kit and how to use it. Feel free to post any comment you have; and do check out the [discussions](https://github.com/Obra-Studio/shadcn-ui-kit/discussions).
