# Obra Find Unbound Variables

Obra Find Unbound Variables is a Figma plugin to find variables with a missing reference.

What often happens when working with variables is that a variable gets deleted, but the variable is still bound to a layer. You can spot this error when you see a little question mark next to the variable name in Figma's right-hand panel. This plugin scans for unbound variables across your file.
