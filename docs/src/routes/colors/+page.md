# Note about colors

_Figure: the colors we included_

Many shadcn/ui kits include all gray-tone colors from Tailwind v4 (Neutral, Stone, Zinc, Gray, Slate, Scaled). On purpose, we only include the “Neutral” pallette for now as well as blue, and red.

We recommend designers to add to the system, not remove, so that’s why we are providing a starting point that is much more bare than other UI kits.

If you want to add more colors, you can use the Obra shadcn/ui Tailwind colors add-on which contains all other official Tailwind v4 colors. Note: Figma does not support OKCLH, so we are using hex variables.

Alternatively, this kit is simple enough that you can choose to customize with your own colors. We’ve marked the colors we are actually using with bold text so you can easily delete unused colours and start from there.
