## Included icons

On purpose, we only included the above Lucide icons, based on usage in the shadcn/ui docs. We could have added all icons here easily, but we did not do that, to keep the library light and focused.

If you need access to the other icons, please use our Figma community file [Obra shadcn/ui Lucide Icons](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1514808850292602897/obra-shadcn-ui-lucide-icons-add-on).

In this file, you'll find all 1500+ Lucide icons.

There's a few strategies you can use now:

1. You can add that file as a library to your work.
2. You might choose to manually the icons in the Figma file itself - to only work with 1 library (this has some usability benefits).

If you don't want to use the add-on file, or new icons release from Lucide, another strategy is to manually add icons from Lucide: go to [the lucide website](https://lucide.dev/) and add the icons you need as a new component. Remember to change the stroke width to 1.5 for consistency and add the same fill color as existing colors.

The setup here makes it realistic to also swap the icons with another popular icon kit. We like [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/), [Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons) and of course our very own [Obra Icons](https://icons.obra.studio/).

However there is an extra benefit to using the icons from our add-ons file: all icons have keywords to easily find icons.
