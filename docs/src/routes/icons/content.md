# Note about icons

_Figure: the icons we included_

On purpose, we only included the above Lucide icons, based on usage in the shadcn/ui docs. We could have added all icons here easily, but we did not do that, to keep the library light and focused.

If you need access to the other icons, please search Figma community for “Obra Shadcn/ui Lucide Icons” and add that file as a library to your work.

You might also choose to add the icons here to only work with 1 library if you wish to work like that (this has some usability benefits).

You can also manually add icons from Lucide: go to https://lucide.dev/ and add the icons you need as a new component. Remember to change the stroke width to 1.5 for consistency and add the same fill color as existing colors.

The setup here makes it realistic to also swap the icons with another popular icon kit. We like Phosphor Icons, Material Icons and of course our very own Obra Icons.
