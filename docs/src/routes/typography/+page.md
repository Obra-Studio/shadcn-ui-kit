# Note about fonts

_Figure: the typographic styles we included_

On purpose, we only provide you with the bare minimum of styles. We built it this way to that you can customise it to your liking.

We stopped where we stopped because the next steps highly depend on:

* Your fonts.
* How far you want to go with type variables.
* The need for using variable fonts (Figma supports them but not fully in variable systems)
