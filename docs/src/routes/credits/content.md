## How this kit came to be

To create the initial version of this kit, every layer and component was designed from scratch by the [Obra Studio](https://obra.studio) team, referencing the official [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) documentation.

Nothing was copied or pasted from existing files or UI kits.

We track the changes in shadcn/ui and keep updating the kit to be up to date with the latest version of shadcn/ui.

## About Obra Studio

## Don't want to design yourself?

We can craft a fully customized version of this shadcn/ui kit, applying best-in-class design system practices and adapting the kit to your brand.

Next to this, we offer to use the customized kit to design product features and flows.

Since we built this kit ourselves, we move fast — and know exactly how to get the most out of the kit.

Your dev team will hit the ground running with clean, production-ready UI.

It's the quickest path from idea to a polished UI — without the hassle of hiring, briefing, or spending hours in Figma yourself.
