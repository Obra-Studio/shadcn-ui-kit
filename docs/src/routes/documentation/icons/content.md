## Default Icons: Lucide

In the Obra shadcn/ui kit, you'll find all 1500+ [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) icons.

We tagged the icons with keywords to make it easy to find them.

The icons that are used are sorted on top, so if you wanted to delete icons you didn't need, you can delete all icons past the blank icon.

## Additional Icon Sets

Since December 2025, [shadcn/ui create](https://ui.shadcn.com/create) allows you to build your own shadcn/ui with different icon sets.

To support this, we published a separate add-on file containing:

- **Tabler Icons** — 5000+ icons, great for projects needing filled variants. MIT license.
- **Phosphor Icons** — 3000+ icons. Phosphor offers multiple weights, but we only included the regular weight to keep the file manageable. More info at [phosphoricons.com](https://phosphoricons.com). MIT license.
- **Remix Icons** — licensed under the [Remix Icon license](https://github.com/Remix-Design/RemixIcon/blob/master/License).
- **Obra Icons** — our custom icon set. More info at [icons.obra.studio](https://icons.obra.studio/). MIT license.

**[Download the Icon Sets Add-on](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1598567387671026948/obra-shadcn-ui-icon-sets-add-on-2026)**

### Why a separate file?

We kept these icon sets in a separate community file because adding them to the main kit would make it too large to publish.

### Note on HugeIcons

HugeIcons is available in shadcn/ui create but omitted from our add-on because it has a restrictive license we don't agree with.
