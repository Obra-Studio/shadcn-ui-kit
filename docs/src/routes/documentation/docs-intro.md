# Documentation

<p class="intro">Welcome to the Obra shadcn/ui kit documentation. Here you can find out how to use this kit, and how to customize it.</p>

## What is the Obra shadcn/ui kit?

The Obra shadcn/ui kit is a design library file that recreates all components of shadcn/ui inside of Figma.

It features 1500+ Lucide Icons, as well as all Tailwind v4 colors.

The kit provides an ideal starting point to start creating a design system based on shadcn/ui.

### Plugin

Next to the library itself, we provide a plugin called [Obra shadcn/ui tools](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1544866255228781486/obra-shadcn-ui-tools) that helps to efficiently work with the kit. Using it is optional, but you might find it very usful when documenting components.

### Business model

We follow another model than other kits, where we provide the kit for free, but provide [customization services with our design team](/customization-services).
