<p class="intro">Welcome to the Obra shadcn/ui kit documentation. Here you can find out how to use this kit, and how to customize it.</p>

## Duplicate the kit

You can find the design file on [Figma community here](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1514746685758799870/obra-shadcn-ui).

## What is the Obra shadcn/ui kit?

The Obra shadcn/ui kit is a design library file that recreates all components of shadcn/ui inside of Figma. We are using the Vega style as a default (see [shadcn/ui create](https://ui.shadcn.com/create)).

The kit features 1500+ Lucide Icons, as well as all Tailwind v4 colors. You can find 4 other icon sets via our [icons community file](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1598567387671026948/obra-shadcn-ui-icon-sets-add-on-2026).

The kit provides an ideal starting point to start creating a design system based on shadcn/ui.

### Plugins

Next to the library itself, we provide a plugin called [Obra shadcn/ui tools](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1544866255228781486/obra-shadcn-ui-tools) that helps to efficiently work with the kit.

Specifically it helps to be faster with creating (and recreating) [Propstar](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1116018586739867857/propstar)-based documentation. Whenever you see a component in the kit, we used Propstar to document its variants.0

Using it is optional, but you might find it very useful when documenting and customizing components.

### Business model

We follow another model than other kits, where we provide the base kit for free, but provide [customization services with our design team](/customization-services).

Recently (February 2026), we decided to add an additional commercial layer on top of our free kit. This will most likely take the form of selling additional kit-related add-ons and plugins.
