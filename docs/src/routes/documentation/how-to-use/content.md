This kit is meant to be customised further. It's the start of your own system.

Just like shadcn/ui, this is not meant to be a final component library. It's how you start building your component library.

To make the kit your own, we recommend to:

1. Remove all blue frames. They are meant as documentation.
2. Customize the thumbnail to your liking. Give it the name of your design system.
3. Customize the theme to your brand (need help with this? We offer consulting services around this with [Obra Studio](https://obra.studio/))
4. Now publish the library to your Figma account (this requires at least a professional account).

Then, consume the library from another file and create your designs.

You can use the bookmark icon in the assets panel to find the controls to do so.
