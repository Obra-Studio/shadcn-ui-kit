This kit is meant to be customised further. It's the start of your own system.

Just like shadcn/ui, this is not meant to be a final component library. It's how you start building your component library.

To use this kit as the start of your own component library, we recommend the following steps:

1. Customize the thumbnail to your liking. Give it the name of your design system. see the thumbnail page
2. Customize the theme to your brand. You can use the first 6 variable collections (semantic colors, typography, border radii, shadows, spacing and chart colors) to theme the kit to your liking.
3. Now publish the library to your Figma account (this requires at least a Figma Professional plan). You can use the bookmark icon in the assets panel to find the controls to do so.
4. Then, consume the library from another file and create your designs. Once again, find the bookmark icon in the assets panel, but this time, add your design library via the "Add to file" function.
