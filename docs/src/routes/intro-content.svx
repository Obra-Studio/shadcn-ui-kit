# Intro

Hi! Welcome to the documentation for Obra shadcn/ui.

These are the docs for a design library file that recreates the components of [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) inside of Figma. This library will evolve over time as it tracks the evolutions in shadcn.

## Credits

Every layer and component was designed from scratch by the [Obra Studio](https://obra.studio) team, referencing the official v4 documentation. Nothing was copied or pasted from existing files or UI kits.

The tailwind colours were sourced from [Yusuf Matraâ€™s kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1371714528425686824/tailwindcss-colors-v4-1-latest-update-2025) which was deemed accurate with the official website.

The only external assets used are icons from Lucide Icons. You can view their license [here](https://lucide.dev/license). (Note that the license is ISC not MIT for the Feather part of Lucide icons)

## How to use this kit

This kit is meant to be customised further. Itâ€™s the start of your own system. Just like shadcn/ui, this is not a component library. Itâ€™s how you start building your component library.

To make the kit your own, we recommend to:

 1. Remove all blue frames. They are meant as documentation.
 2. Customise the thumbnail to your liking. Give it the name of your design system.
 3. Now publish the library to your Figma account (this requires at least a professional account).

Then, consume the library from another file. You can use the bookmark icon in the assets panel to find the controls to do so.
