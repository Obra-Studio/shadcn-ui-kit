We've released the 1.2.0 version of our kit this Saturday evening. You can find the kit [via this Figma community link](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1514746685758799870/obra-shadcn-ui).

This release focuses on two main aspects:

1. We reorganized the file with a page-based organization as per popular request - and to work around some performance issues
2. We revised the theming layer to make it easier to make customizations, with a setup that puts your own brand - literally - in the first place

We go through the changes in this video:
