Hi everyone, we would like to have some community feedback around adding variables for spacing and border radius in our shadcn/ui kit.

[You can join the discussion and add your thoughts here](https://github.com/Obra-Studio/shadcn-ui-kit/discussions/51). We'd like your opinion! Currently, 2 people have voted with a 50/50 split between not adding it or adding it.

Your opinion matters for the evolution of the kit, as the outcome of this question directly leads to possible work on expanding the semantic layer.
