We've released the 1.1.0 version of our kit.

This releases focuses on completeness and on fixing some bugs.

It also adds a round variant to many components such as inputs and buttons.

We track the visual look of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). Whenever they make a change, we also make a change to the kit.
