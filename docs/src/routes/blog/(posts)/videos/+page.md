We've added 2 new videos the [videos](https://shadcn.obra.studio/videos) section. One is about starting a design with the kit; another is about adding components to an existing design and customizing it.

We are motivated by community requests and having a real conversation about our kit. So if you have any video requests, don't hesitate to tweet to [@wolfr_2](https://x.com/wolfr_2) or <a href="https://github.com/Obra-Studio/shadcn-ui-kit/issues">log your request as a Github issue</a>!
