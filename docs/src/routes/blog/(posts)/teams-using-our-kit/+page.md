I'm happy to report that we've heard from several teams, to be exact, that they started using our kit as a base for their system.

We heard Belgian-based [Payflip](https://payflip.be/en/) and Brazil-based [Omnismart](https://omnismart.com.br/) made the choice to use our kit. Very cool!

Here is some nice words from Emmanuel Tomiyoshi, product designer at OmniSmart:

> I gotta tell, you saved me time, money and headache. That file is just right what my team have been looking for. Too much advanced. The right techniques. As someone who's been deep diving on Design Systems and helping software companies to scale their products with multi-whitelabel-themed systems, this is a rare gem.

> We’re actually starting today with your file as our system foundation. I’ve tested FramesX, AlignUI, Untitled UI, you name it. And even shadcn Figma file (I didn't buy it, but I saw the preview and it didn't look too much right). After analysing, yours filled the gaps they didn’t.

[Our kit has close to 2000 duplicates on Figma community](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1514746685758799870/obra-shadcn-ui). We’ve started working on an internal project where we are putting it through its paces and fixing some small issues as we encounter them.

Awesome!
