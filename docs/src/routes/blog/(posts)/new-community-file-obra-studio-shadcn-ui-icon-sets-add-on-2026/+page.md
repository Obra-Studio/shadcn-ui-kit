In December '25, shadcn released shadcn/ui create.

This feature, available at [ui.shadcn.com/create](https://ui.shadcn.com/create) allows you to build your own shadcn/ui.

As part of the feature, people can choose their icon set and have the choice between Lucide, Tabler Icons, HugeIcons, Phosphor Icons, and Remix Icons.

By default, our popular [Obra shadcn/ui kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1514746685758799870/obra-shadcn-ui) contains Lucide icons.

However, in projects, we are often missing filled icons and just more icons in general. While Lucide is great, the 1500 icons are easily dwarfed by the 5000+ in Tabler.

We published a new file to our Obra Studio profile which contains Tabler Icons, Phosphor Icons, Remix Icons, and our very own Obra Icons.

We omitted Huge Icons because of their restrictive license agreement.

This file can help teams make the swap to other icon sets to customize the shadcn/ui kit.

We did not add these assets to the actual kit on purpose, as it would make the library large and impossible to publish.
