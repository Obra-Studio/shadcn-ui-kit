In order for this project to continue as an open source project, we are in need of sponsors.

Light sponsorship ($25, $50...) will help with the continuation of this project.

Heavy sponsorship ($1000) can lead to benefits such as:

* private team consultation about the usage of the kit
* early access to new versions
* access to custom components that are built within the same kit

Currently, we are setting up our Github profile to be ready for sponsorship. The ideas are around this are early.
