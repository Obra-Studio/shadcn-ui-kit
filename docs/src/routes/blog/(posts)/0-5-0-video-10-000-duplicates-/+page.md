Hi community, we've reached the insanely nice milestone of having 10,000 people that duplicated our UI kit. We're very happy with this milestone! We see that the kit has great momentum with over a thousand duplicates a week. If you are using the kit as the base of your own design system, [we'd love to hear from you](https://obra.studio/contact).

We're pretty close to the 1.0 release with a likely release next week, on September 18th. You can find more info in the [Road to 1.0](https://github.com/Obra-Studio/shadcn-ui-kit/issues/56) Github issue.

I just recorded a video about 0.5.0 with the biggest changes. Those are the theming layer and the inclusion of example screens. You can find the video that explains the changes below.
