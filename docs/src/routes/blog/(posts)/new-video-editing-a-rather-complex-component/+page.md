Shadcn teased some new components on X, see this [post](https://x.com/shadcn/status/1971571541264760861/photo/1).

This led me recording a new video where I use our [Obra shadcn/ui kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1514746685758799870/obra-shadcn-ui) and show an example of editing an already complex component, to demonstrate how to make an addition to the kit.

In the video, I am using a combination of plugins to automate manual work: I used [Groupify](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1217139200233599015/groupify), [Propstar](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1116018586739867857/propstar), [Similayer](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/735733267883397781/similayer), as well as the [Obra shadcn/ui tools](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1544866255228781486/obra-shadcn-ui-tools) to make an edit to a complex component in just a few minutes.

By the way, we released the 1.0 version of our kit last Thursday. The kit has now been duplicated over 12,000 times!

I'd like to repeat our call to action from last time—as we added more features, but in a way still like a simpler kit, we’d love to hear your thoughts. Perhaps different versions of the kit can be offered for different needs. If you have any thoughts on this, please [contribute in this discussion](https://github.com/Obra-Studio/shadcn-ui-kit/discussions/68).
