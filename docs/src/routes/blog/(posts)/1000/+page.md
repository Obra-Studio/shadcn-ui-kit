We've reached over a thousand duplicates for our [shadcn/ui kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1514746685758799870) üéâ!

In fact, I planned to write this blog post and as of the time of writing the counter is already at 1300 users. Wow!

Despite this number, we haven't received that much feedback yet. From my experience with Figma plugins and files, sometimes this number goes up quite quickly, without people actually using the file, just checking it out.  It is almost like a ‚Äúvisited‚Äù number and not really like a usage number.

* If you build something with our kit, we would love to see it! Show it off in a new issue at [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Obra-Studio/shadcn-ui-kit/issues) or tweet to [@obra_studio_2](https://twitter.com/obra_studio_2). 
* If you have any comment or suggestion, it's more than welcome at our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Obra-Studio/shadcn-ui-kit/issues).

Currently, we are planning to add some videos to YouTube to make it more clear how the kit can be used. Check out the existing videos [here](/videos). These videos will also serve as Figma tutorials. If you have any specific video requests, something that you wanted to know about Figma and never dared to ask, also feel free to put this in the GitHub issue.
