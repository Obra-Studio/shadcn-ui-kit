We released 1.3.0 of our Obra shadcn/ui kit for Figma.

[You can duplicate the new community file here.](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1514746685758799870/obra-shadcn-ui).

This is a release that follows quickly from 1.2.0 in which we enhance the theming layer improvements we introduced in 1.2.0.

The main changes include the following:

* Add spacing to the theming layer: you can now adjust spacing by adjusting the `your_brand` collection
* Scope variables to the right scope, for example, have fill variables

We have been getting some questions around updating the kit. I made a video last month around this topic, which you find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2sW2iKpCxY). 

For the details, please head over to the [changelog](/changelog).
