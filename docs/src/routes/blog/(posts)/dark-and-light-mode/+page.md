Following the discussion to [add the variables for spacing and border radius](https://github.com/Obra-Studio/shadcn-ui-kit/discussions/51), we would like the community's opinion on adding light and dark mode to the kit.

This change would implement the [theming](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/theming) layer of shadcn/ui along with likely some extra variables for things that can't be simulated in Figma (e.g. opacity of variables)

We are also looking for somebody who can contribute this change if it's voted in.

[Please contribute with your vote here](https://github.com/Obra-Studio/shadcn-ui-kit/discussions/52).
