We've released the 0.5.0 version of our kit! This is one of our biggest releases so far.

Highlights of this new version include the inclusion of light and dark mode and subsequently theming variables. This will make it much easier for users of the kit to customize the theme to their liking.

We've improved consistency with shadcn/ui itself, and we've fixed some long-standing bugs. 

Next to this, we added example screens to get started with your designs.

[Check out the full changelog here](/changelog).

We've been shifting the dates for the 1.0 release a few times but with this feature release, we are confident we can call the kit stable very soon. We're aimign for a release date on September 18, 2025 now.
